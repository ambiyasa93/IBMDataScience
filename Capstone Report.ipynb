    "One of the bank product is loan. in order to reduce risk of potential loss in revenue, a bank is taking a collateral for the loan. lot of people giving his/her home as a collateral. A collateral value is the estimated fair market value of an asset that is being used as loan collateral. Collateral value is determined by appraisal from a qualified expert. usually, the bank hire appraisal company to do this task. In this project, i will try to create a regression model for houses prices. the aim is helping the bank to estimate houses price for collateral appraisal, so the bank doesn't too much dependent on the appraisal company. \n",
